# searchiTunesApp
This app searches keyword and displays result in a tableview. Optionally, this app displays top rated movies from tmdb api. 

#Note:
I developed this application as a part of our course. This app can search any keyword in iTunes and display to the user. 
I have used iTunes api as an endpoint. 

Additionally, the landing page or the "Home" section displays top rated movies from tmdb api. 
This app has been developed in Swift Programming language. 

The "Search" section is where the user can look for the items. 

Also, any user can save the specific movie, app, music or book to the local disk, which in this case is the iPhone itself.
S/he can view it in a different section called 'Favourites'.

#Before you go..
If you would like to run this application, please make sure you have your API KEY for tmdb. 
You can go to the folder named helper and look for "TOPMOVIES" url. 
Remove API_KEY_HERE, insert your API KEY and save.
